Friend Network Manager              

   The Friend Network Manager is a console application that uses a graph to simulate and manage social connections. It models people as nodes and friendships as edges, allowing users to explore relationships and suggest friends based on shared connections.

What It Can Do

● Add people to the social network.

● Establish friendships between people.

● Display all friendships in the network.

● Suggest friends based on mutual connections.

Why This Application Was Made

This project was developed to provide a hands-on example of graph structures and algorithms. It helps in understanding how social networks like Facebook or LinkedIn use graph theory to manage and suggest connections.

How It Contributes to You and the Community

● For Me: Enhances my understanding of graph data structures, algorithms, and their applications in Java.

● For the Community: Demonstrates a practical use of graphs in social networking, inspiring others to build similar applications.
